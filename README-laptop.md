### Laptop-Sized ###

The full-sized version has the disadvantage that it relies on
arrow keys or the Numpad. Since most laptops have tiny (or
inexistent) arrow keys we also provide a second executable which
uses more convetional keys.  
The disadvantage here is that it interferes with regular typing (you
won't be able to type while it. To
mitigate this, the 

The following 5 items are all you need to know to play the game:

* `I`, `J`, `K`, and `L` move around;
* `Space` or `O` click the mouse (that's the letter O, not the
number);
* `E`, `8` or `Shift+Space` end your turn;
* `M` clicks the "*Play*" button at the bottom-left of some
  screens. This way you can get right back into the game without
  touching the mouse.
* `Return` is important, read at the bottom.
  
Also, for convenience:

* `N` clicks the right mouse button (used for cancelling actions);
* `P` and `U` work like the right `Ctrl` key.
* `B` clicks the options button.
* All keys specified for the [full-sized version][The Standard Version] also apply.

### Chatting ###

Another important key is `Return`. Hitting it will cause *Keystone* to
stop intercepting keys. Since `Return` is also the key that opens and
closes the chat box, this should allow you to chat with friends
without issue (*Keystone* will be paused when you open the chat box
and will unpause when you send the message). The exception is that if
you open or close the chat box using the mouse, *Keystone* will be
paused or unpaused when it shouldn't. If that happens, just remember
you can also pause/unpause manually using the `Pause/Break` key.
