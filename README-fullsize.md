### Full-Sized ###

The following 4 items are all you need to know to play the game:

* `Arrow Keys` move around; if you hold `Shift`, the `Right` and
  `Left` keys will use smaller steps (almost never needed);
* `Numpad 0` clicks the mouse;
* `End` ends your turn;
* `Page Down` clicks the "*Play*" button at the bottom-left of some
  screens. This way you can get right back into the game without
  touching the mouse.

The `End` key is a bit of a stretch to reach from the arrow keys, but
that's *intentional*, so you don't hit it by accident (after all, it
ends your turn).  
Furthermore, there are some more keys, for convenience:

* `Numpad 1` clicks the right mouse button (used for cancelling actions).
* The right `Ctrl` key places the mouse on you hero power. Pressing it again will move to your hero icon, then your enemy's icon. All of these can also be reached with the arrow keys.
* `Numpad Arrows` work like arrow keys (`Numpad 5` also works like
`Down`).
* `Numpad -` ends your turn.
* `Numpad 7` and `9` are similar to the right `Ctrl` key.
* `Page Up` opens the options menu, and leaves the mouse right below "*Concede*" button.
* `Scroll Lock` or `Num Lock` reload *Keystone*, **must** be pressed if you move the
window or change the resolution.
* The `Pause/Break` key pauses and unpauses *Keystone*, which will free up all
the keys (except for `Pause/Break`).
